# Vision playground

Vision playground is as the name suggest just a playground project for 2D/3D test and simulations in python.

**Core features in vision playground**

- Camera and/or Lidar simulation
- 3D reconstruction
- 2D detection 

## Camera simulation
Give a 3D scene and a sequence of poses and it'll save all the images of the 3D scene at those poses.

## Lidar simulation and 3D reconstruction
Give a 3D scene and a sequence of poses and it'll get the RGBD images of the 3D scene at those poses and do a 3D reconstruction from them.

## 2D detection
Give an image and it'll run ML object detection on it.

## Possible futur features
- Feature detection and matching
- 3D reconstruction from RGB
- 2D segmentation
